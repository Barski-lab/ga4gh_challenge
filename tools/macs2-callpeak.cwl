  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit

  Input files arguments:
    -t TFILE [TFILE ...], --treatment TFILE [TFILE ...]
                          ChIP-seq treatment file. If multiple files are given
                          as '-t A B C', then they will all be read and pooled
                          together. REQUIRED.
    -c [CFILE [CFILE ...]], --control [CFILE [CFILE ...]]
                          Control file. If multiple files are given as '-c A B
                          C', they will be pooled to estimate ChIP-seq
                          background noise.
    -f {AUTO,BAM,SAM,BED,ELAND,ELANDMULTI,ELANDEXPORT,BOWTIE,BAMPE,BEDPE}, --format {AUTO,BAM,SAM,BED,ELAND,ELANDMULTI,ELANDEXPORT,BOWTIE,BAMPE,BEDPE}
                          Format of tag file, "AUTO", "BED" or "ELAND" or
                          "ELANDMULTI" or "ELANDEXPORT" or "SAM" or "BAM" or
                          "BOWTIE" or "BAMPE" or "BEDPE". The default AUTO
                          option will let MACS decide which format (except for
                          BAMPE and BEDPE which should be implicitly set) the
                          file is. Please check the definition in README. Please
                          note that if the format is set as BAMPE or BEDPE,
                          MACS2 will call its special Paired-end mode to call
                          peaks by piling up the actual ChIPed fragments defined
                          by both aligned ends, instead of predicting the
                          fragment size first and extending reads. Also please
                          note that the BEDPE only contains three columns, and
                          is NOT the same BEDPE format used by BEDTOOLS.
                          DEFAULT: "AUTO"
    -g GSIZE, --gsize GSIZE
                          Effective genome size. It can be 1.0e+9 or 1000000000,
                          or shortcuts:'hs' for human (2.7e9), 'mm' for mouse
                          (1.87e9), 'ce' for C. elegans (9e7) and 'dm' for
                          fruitfly (1.2e8), Default:hs
    --keep-dup KEEPDUPLICATES
                          It controls the MACS behavior towards duplicate tags
                          at the exact same location -- the same coordination
                          and the same strand. The 'auto' option makes MACS
                          calculate the maximum tags at the exact same location
                          based on binomal distribution using 1e-5 as pvalue
                          cutoff; and the 'all' option keeps every tags. If an
                          integer is given, at most this number of tags will be
                          kept at the same location. Note, if you've used
                          samtools or picard to flag reads as 'PCR/Optical
                          duplicate' in bit 1024, MACS2 will still read them
                          although the reads may be decided by MACS2 as
                          duplicate later. The default is to keep one tag at the
                          same location. Default: 1
    --buffer-size BUFFER_SIZE
                          Buffer size for incrementally increasing internal
                          array size to store reads alignment information. In
                          most cases, you don't have to change this parameter.
                          However, if there are large number of
                          chromosomes/contigs/scaffolds in your alignment, it's
                          recommended to specify a smaller buffer size in order
                          to decrease memory usage (but it will take longer time
                          to read alignment files). Minimum memory requested for
                          reading an alignment file is about # of CHROMOSOME *
                          BUFFER_SIZE * 2 Bytes. DEFAULT: 100000

  Output arguments:
    --outdir OUTDIR       If specified all output files will be written to that
                          directory. Default: the current working directory
    -n NAME, --name NAME  Experiment name, which will be used to generate output
                          file names. DEFAULT: "NA"
    -B, --bdg             Whether or not to save extended fragment pileup, and
                          local lambda tracks (two files) at every bp into a
                          bedGraph file. DEFAULT: False
    --verbose VERBOSE     Set verbose level of runtime message. 0: only show
                          critical message, 1: show additional warning message,
                          2: show process information, 3: show debug messages.
                          DEFAULT:2
    --trackline           Tells MACS to include trackline with bedGraph files.
                          To include this trackline while displaying bedGraph at
                          UCSC genome browser, can show name and description of
                          the file as well. However my suggestion is to convert
                          bedGraph to bigWig, then show the smaller and faster
                          binary bigWig file at UCSC genome browser, as well as
                          downstream analysis. Require -B to be set. Default:
                          Not include trackline.
    --SPMR                If True, MACS will save signal per million reads for
                          fragment pileup profiles. Require -B to be set.
                          Default: False

  Shifting model arguments:
    -s TSIZE, --tsize TSIZE
                          Tag size. This will override the auto detected tag
                          size. DEFAULT: Not set
    --bw BW               Band width for picking regions to compute fragment
                          size. This value is only used while building the
                          shifting model. DEFAULT: 300
    -m MFOLD MFOLD, --mfold MFOLD MFOLD
                          Select the regions within MFOLD range of high-
                          confidence enrichment ratio against background to
                          build model. Fold-enrichment in regions must be lower
                          than upper limit, and higher than the lower limit. Use
                          as "-m 10 30". DEFAULT:5 50
    --fix-bimodal         Whether turn on the auto pair model process. If set,
                          when MACS failed to build paired model, it will use
                          the nomodel settings, the --exsize parameter to extend
                          each tags towards 3' direction. Not to use this
                          automate fixation is a default behavior now. DEFAULT:
                          False
    --nomodel             Whether or not to build the shifting model. If True,
                          MACS will not build model. by default it means
                          shifting size = 100, try to set extsize to change it.
                          DEFAULT: False
    --shift SHIFT         (NOT the legacy --shiftsize option!) The arbitrary
                          shift in bp. Use discretion while setting it other
                          than default value. When NOMODEL is set, MACS will use
                          this value to move cutting ends (5') towards 5'->3'
                          direction then apply EXTSIZE to extend them to
                          fragments. When this value is negative, ends will be
                          moved toward 3'->5' direction. Recommended to keep it
                          as default 0 for ChIP-Seq datasets, or -1 * half of
                          EXTSIZE together with EXTSIZE option for detecting
                          enriched cutting loci such as certain DNAseI-Seq
                          datasets. Note, you can't set values other than 0 if
                          format is BAMPE or BEDPE for paired-end data. DEFAULT:
                          0.
    --extsize EXTSIZE     The arbitrary extension size in bp. When nomodel is
                          true, MACS will use this value as fragment size to
                          extend each read towards 3' end, then pile them up.
                          It's exactly twice the number of obsolete SHIFTSIZE.
                          In previous language, each read is moved 5'->3'
                          direction to middle of fragment by 1/2 d, then
                          extended to both direction with 1/2 d. This is
                          equivalent to say each read is extended towards 5'->3'
                          into a d size fragment. DEFAULT: 200. EXTSIZE and
                          SHIFT can be combined when necessary. Check SHIFT
                          option.

  Peak calling arguments:
    -q QVALUE, --qvalue QVALUE
                          Minimum FDR (q-value) cutoff for peak detection.
                          DEFAULT: 0.05. -q, and -p are mutually exclusive.
    -p PVALUE, --pvalue PVALUE
                          Pvalue cutoff for peak detection. DEFAULT: not set.
                          -q, and -p are mutually exclusive. If pvalue cutoff is
                          set, qvalue will not be calculated and reported as -1
                          in the final .xls file.
    --to-large            When set, scale the small sample up to the bigger
                          sample. By default, the bigger dataset will be scaled
                          down towards the smaller dataset, which will lead to
                          smaller p/qvalues and more specific results. Keep in
                          mind that scaling down will bring down background
                          noise more. DEFAULT: False
    --ratio RATIO         When set, use a custom scaling ratio of ChIP/control
                          (e.g. calculated using NCIS) for linear scaling.
                          DEFAULT: ingore
    --down-sample         When set, random sampling method will scale down the
                          bigger sample. By default, MACS uses linear scaling.
                          Warning: This option will make your result unstable
                          and irreproducible since each time, random reads would
                          be selected. Consider to use 'randsample' script
                          instead. <not implmented>If used together with --SPMR,
                          1 million unique reads will be randomly picked.</not
                          implemented> Caution: due to the implementation, the
                          final number of selected reads may not be as you
                          expected! DEFAULT: False
    --seed SEED           Set the random seed while down sampling data. Must be
                          a non-negative integer in order to be effective.
                          DEFAULT: not set
    --tempdir TEMPDIR     Optional directory to store temp files. DEFAULT: /tmp
    --nolambda            If True, MACS will use fixed background lambda as
                          local lambda for every peak region. Normally, MACS
                          calculates a dynamic local lambda to reflect the local
                          bias due to potential chromatin structure.
    --slocal SMALLLOCAL   The small nearby region in basepairs to calculate
                          dynamic lambda. This is used to capture the bias near
                          the peak summit region. Invalid if there is no control
                          data. If you set this to 0, MACS will skip slocal
                          lambda calculation. *Note* that MACS will always
                          perform a d-size local lambda calculation. The final
                          local bias should be the maximum of the lambda value
                          from d, slocal, and llocal size windows. DEFAULT: 1000
    --llocal LARGELOCAL   The large nearby region in basepairs to calculate
                          dynamic lambda. This is used to capture the surround
                          bias. If you set this to 0, MACS will skip llocal
                          lambda calculation. *Note* that MACS will always
                          perform a d-size local lambda calculation. The final
                          local bias should be the maximum of the lambda value
                          from d, slocal, and llocal size windows. DEFAULT:
                          10000.
    --broad               If set, MACS will try to call broad peaks by linking
                          nearby highly enriched regions. The linking region is
                          controlled by another cutoff through --linking-cutoff.
                          The maximum linking region length is 4 times of d from
                          MACS. DEFAULT: False
    --broad-cutoff BROADCUTOFF
                          Cutoff for broad region. This option is not available
                          unless --broad is set. If -p is set, this is a pvalue
                          cutoff, otherwise, it's a qvalue cutoff. DEFAULT: 0.1
    --cutoff-analysis     While set, MACS2 will analyze number or total length
                          of peaks that can be called by different p-value
                          cutoff then output a summary table to help user decide
                          a better cutoff. The table will be saved in
                          NAME_cutoff_analysis.txt file. Note, minlen and maxgap
                          may affect the results. WARNING: May take ~30 folds
                          longer time to finish. DEFAULT: False

  Post-processing options:
    --call-summits        If set, MACS will use a more sophisticated signal
                          processing approach to find subpeak summits in each
                          enriched peak region. DEFAULT: False
    --fe-cutoff FECUTOFF  When set, the value will be used to filter out peaks
                          with low fold-enrichment. Note, MACS2 use 1.0 as
                          pseudocount while calculating fold-enrichment.
                          DEFAULT: 1.0
