  The FASTX-Toolkit is a collection of command line tools for Short-Reads FASTA/FASTQ files preprocessing.
  Available Tools:
    FASTQ-to-FASTA converter (Convert FASTQ files to FASTA files)
    FASTQ Information (Chart Quality Statistics and Nucleotide Distribution)
    FASTQ/A Collapser (Collapsing identical sequences in a FASTQ/A file into a single sequence)
    FASTQ/A Trimmer (Shortening reads in a FASTQ or FASTQ files, removing barcodes or noise)
    FASTQ/A Renamer (Renames the sequence identifiers in FASTQ/A file)
    FASTQ/A Clipper (Removing sequencing adapters/linkers)
    FASTQ/A Reverse-Complement (Producing the Reverse-complement of each sequence in a FASTQ/FASTA file)
    FASTQ/A Barcode splitter (Splitting a FASTQ/FASTA files containning multiple samples)
    FASTA Formatter (changes the width of sequences line in a FASTA file)
    FASTA Nucleotide Changer (Convets FASTA sequences from/to RNA/DNA)
    FASTQ Quality Filter (Filters sequences based on quality)
    FASTQ Quality Trimmer (Trims (cuts) sequences based on quality)
    FASTQ Masker (Masks nucleotides with 'N' (or other character) based on quality)
