s:about: |
  With the improvement of sequencing techniques, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput
  sequencing (ChIP-Seq) is getting popular to study genome-wide protein-DNA interactions. To address the
  lack of powerful ChIP-Seq analysis method, we present a novel algorithm, named Model-based Analysis
  of ChIP-Seq (MACS), for identifying transcript factor binding sites. MACS captures the influence of
  genome complexity to evaluate the significance of enriched ChIP regions, and MACS improves the spatial
  resolution of binding sites through combining the information of both sequencing tag position and
  orientation. MACS can be easily used for ChIP-Seq data alone, or with control sample with the increase
  of specificity.
